# Codestrands
# Inspiration
We have all had our fair share of trouble when faced with a limited knowledge of a tech stack in a personal project, and programming alone gets boring. Together, we developed Codestrands - a Tinder-like app in which programmers can swipe to meet project collaborators based on their skills and interests listed on their profile. 
# What it does
Using a mix of rigid credibility and intimate vulnerability, Codestrands profiles exhibit both the corporate and compassionate sides of each user to string together tight-knit companionships in open source passion projects. The sleek look and feel of the application coupled with it's choice profile layout lets you and others see the best of each other while maintaining its efficiency and practicality in searching for collaborators. List your projects, skills, interests, and biography for the programming world to see.
