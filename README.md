# Codestrands
# Inspiration
We have all had our fair share of trouble when faced with a limited knowledge of a tech stack in a personal project, and programming alone gets boring. Together, we developed Codestrands - a Tinder-like app in which programmers can swipe to meet project collaborators based on their skills and interests listed on their profile. 
# What it does
Using a mix of rigid credibility and intimate vulnerability, Codestrands profiles exhibit both the corporate and compassionate sides of each user to string together tight-knit companionships in open source passion projects. The sleek look and feel of the application coupled with it's choice profile layout lets you and others see the best of each other while maintaining its efficiency and practicality in searching for collaborators. List your projects, skills, interests, and biography for the programming world to see.
# How we built it
Our comprehensive backend in Rust, the most beloved language by its users on Stack Overflow, served us well with its inbuilt API library Actix Web. Our frontend was a multilayered amalgamation of Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI components to further enhance the modern feel.
# Challenges we ran into
The time constraint of 36 hours was a bit much on our ambitious idea. This led to drowsiness due to lack of rest, which hindered our full potential. As this was many of our first hackathons and our first one together, our inexperience with the format and many tech stacks in general led to a real challenge.
